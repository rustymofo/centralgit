Git has three stages of workflow -1. Working area 2. Staging area 3. Local Repository.
We send data or code from working aria to staging aria by add command and staging aria to Local repository by
commit command and finally send data/code from Local repo to central repo by push command.
Basic commands: 

# yum update -y
# yum install git -y
# which git
# git –version
# git config –-global user.name “saksham”
# git config –-global user.email "chauhansaksham@gmail.com"
# git config –list
